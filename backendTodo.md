1. Initial Setup
   - [x]Set up a new Node.js project with Express.
   - [x]Install necessary dependencies:
   - [x]express (for routing and API handling)
   - [x]mongoose (for MongoDB integration)
   - [x]jsonwebtoken (for JWT-based authentication)
   - [x]bcryptjs (for hashing passwords)
   - [x]cors (for cross-origin resource sharing)
   - [x]dotenv (for environment variables)
   - [ ]socket.io (for real-time updates)
2. Authentication
   - [x]Create User model in Mongoose with fields: name, email, password, profile picture.
   - [x]Create JWT authentication middleware (for protecting routes).
   - [x]Implement signup route:
   - [x]Validate email, password, and create a new user.
   - [x]Hash the password with bcrypt.
   - [x]Implement login route:
   - [x]Verify email and password, generate JWT token, and send it to the user.
3. User Routes
   - [x]Implement user profile route (GET & PUT).
   - [x]Implement friendship system (users can add/remove friends).
4. Workout Plan Management
   - [x]Create WorkoutPlan model in Mongoose with fields like exercises (name, sets, reps, weights), user reference.
   - [x]Implement routes to:
   - [x]Create a new workout plan.
   - [x]Update workout plans.
   - [x]Fetch workout plans for a user.
5. Progress Tracker
   - [ ]Create Progress model in Mongoose (date, sets, reps, weights, workout plan reference).
   - [ ]Implement routes to:
   - [ ]Log progress data.
   - [ ]Fetch progress over time.
6. Personal Bests (PBs)
   - [x]Create PB model (exercise, weight lifted, date, user reference).
   - [ ]Implement routes to:
   - [ ]Post a new PB.
   - [ ]Fetch all PBs for a user.
   - [ ]Fetch PBs for leaderboard calculations.
7. Leaderboards
   - [ ]Implement global leaderboard route (fetch users sorted by PB performance).
   - [ ]Implement friends leaderboard (fetch top friends sorted by performance).
   - [ ]Set up Socket.io to update leaderboards in real time when new PBs are posted.
8. Push Notifications
   - [ ]Implement push notification system (Firebase Cloud Messaging or a similar service).
   - [ ]Send notifications to users for new PBs, friend activity, etc.
9. API Documentation
   - [ ]Set up Swagger for API documentation or create a manual API documentation for developers.
10. Testing
   - [ ] Write unit tests for utility functions and API routes (using Jest or Mocha).
   - [ ] Write integration tests for authentication and workout tracking features.
11. Deployment
   - [ ] Deploy backend to Heroku, Render, or another cloud platform.
   - [ ] Set up MongoDB Atlas for cloud database.
   - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.
